# Introduction

People mostly use kubernetes for one of the following benefits:
- Development velocity
- Scaling (of both software and teams)
- Abstracting your infrastructure
- Efficiency
- Cloud native ecosystem

## Velocity

The core concepts that enable this are:
- **Immutability**: Immutable container images are at the core of everything that you will build in
Kubernetes
- **Declarative configuration** : While imperative commands define actions, declarative configurations define state.
- **Online self-healing systems**: Kubernetes continuously takes actions to ensure that the current state matches the desired state.
- Shared reusable libraries and tools
