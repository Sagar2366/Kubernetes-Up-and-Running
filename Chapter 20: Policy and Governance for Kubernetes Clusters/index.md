# Policy and Governance for Kubernetes Clusters

Policy is a set of constraints and conditions for how Kubernetes resources can be configured. Governance provides the ability to verify and enforce organizational policies for allresources deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, such as ensuring all resources use current best practices, comply with security policy, or adhere to company conventions.

## Why Policy and Governance Matter

NetworkPolicy allows you to specify what network services and endpoints a Pod can connect to. 

Here are some common examples of policies that cluster administrators often
configure:
- All containers must only come from a specific container registry
- All Pods must be labeled with the department name and contact information
- All Pods must have both CPU and memory resource limits set
- All Ingress hostnames must be unique across a cluster
- A certain service must not be made available on the internet
- Containers must not listen on privileged ports

## Admission Flow

Admission controllers operate inline as an API request flows through the Kubernetes API server and are used to either mutate or validate the API request resource
before itâ€™s saved to storage. Mutating admission controllers allow the resource to be modified; validating admission controllers do not. There are many different types of admission controllers; this chapter focuses on admission webhooks, which are dynamically configurable. They allow a cluster administrator to configure an endpoint to which the API server can send requests for evaluation by creating either a MutatingWebhookConfiguration or a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource.

## Policy and Governance with Gatekeeper

Here, we will focus on an open source ecosystem project called [Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/). Gatekeeper is a Kubernetes-native policy controller that evaluates resources based on defined policy and determines whether to allow a Kubernetes resource to be created or modified. These evaluations happen server-side as the API request flows through the Kubernetes API server, which means each cluster has a single point of processing. Processing the policy evaluations server-side means that you can install Gatekeeper on existing Kubernetes clusters without changing developer tooling, workflows, or continuous delivery pipelines.

Gatekeeper uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) to define a new set of Kubernetes resources specific to configuring it, which allows cluster administrators to use familiar tools like kubectl to operate Gatekeeper. In addition, it provides real-time, meaningful feedback to the user on why a resource was denied and how to remediate the problem. These Gatekeeper-specific custom resources can be stored in source control and managed using GitOps workflows. Gatekeeper also performs resource mutation (resource modification based on defined conditions) and auditing.
